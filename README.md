# Music Composer

A Markov Chain Model based music composer - *2016 Science Fair Project*

## Motivation ##

With a growing interest in the applications of Artificial Intelligence, I was particularly interested in an inanimate object, such as a computer expressing creativity. Combining this idea with my love for music, I wanted to find a develop a program that would allow a computer to take input melodies and develop it's own unique melody out of them. 

## Abstract ##
Music composition offers interesting challenges when being applied to computers or other machines. Musical composition can be approached by using a variety of methods. Some of these paths include using a probabilistic analysis and utilizing neural networks that can be used to feed data to a computer. This data being fed into the computer effectively trains the computers and hones its skill in a certain skill set. In my case this skill set is the ability to compose music. I intend to use music composition as a means of comparing the growth of a human’s skills compared to that of a machine’s or a computer. I want this computer program to be used, not only by people who have a serious goal of composing unique music, but also people who are looking to explore their creative strong points to see what they can produce. This program can be incorporated into a psychological method that helps certain patients recover from traumatic and difficult situations. I believe this program has the power to revolutionize the way we create music.
